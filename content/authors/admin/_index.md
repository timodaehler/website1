My name is Timo. I have an academic background in economics and professional experience in investment analysis. When I don't spend my free time discovering the Swiss alps, I dabble in data science: Over the years, I have grown a particular interest in data visualization and coummunicating data-driven insights. 

I've always lived at the intersection of different (and sometimes opposing) worlds: a PhD economist who cares more about understanding the  about than the mathematical beauty of a theory, a creative fiction writer with a mathy bent, and a rigorous researcher who is laser-focused on causal inference and the messy interactions of the real world. 

If you think we could collaborate on cool work, I'd love to hear from you!
